During my visits to these regions, I saw countless children unable to attend school simply because their parents couldn\u2019t afford it. Some children lacked interest in school due to difficult circumstances, while others attended in extremely poor conditions. I saw children walking barefoot or wearing worn-out slippers, carrying their books and notebooks in their hands because they didn\u2019t have school bags. Many of them had to walk long distances\u2014sometimes 2 to 3 kilometers or more\u2014just to reach school. The paths they took were often dangerous, yet they continued their journey with determination. Before even setting off for school, these children had to complete household chores and help their families. Despite their hardships, they had a strong desire to learn and grow, but poverty held them back. This is why I created Give With Smile\u2014to bridge the gap and provide these children with the resources they need to pursue their education. A small donation\u2014whether it's money, clothes, school supplies, or even a pair of shoes\u2014can change a child's future. Together, we can uplift these children, giving them hope, dignity, and a chance to build a better tomorrow. Let\u2019s join hands and make a difference\u2014one smile at a time!
